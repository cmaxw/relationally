# What is Relationally?

I've used a TON of different CRMs. The problem is that they are either
too complicated, or don't allow me to really focus on the
relationship. They mostly focus on the "Deal" or the "Job." I care
about those things, but I feel like if I take care of the *person*, I
can win the job. That's why it's a *CR*M and not a *Get-a-job*M system.

Since "Relationship Marketing" is about the relationship, I want a
system that enables my relationship by doing the following:

* Reminds me to contact people on a regular basis
* Keeps track of how I know them and the ways I can reach out to them
* Tells me important things about them
* Tracks their interests and details about the projects/things they care about
* Add contacts to a group so I can determine how and when to contact
  them
* Allows me to email, tweet, facebook, etc them through the
  application
* Includes some email, tweet, facebook, etc templates for reaching out
* Allows me to forward/cc emails to it that add context to contacts
* Automatically creates contacts from emails (previous point)
* Integrates nicely with Redmine
* Provides API's for third party applications
* Tracks tasks related to the contact
* Reminds me every X days when I waiting on information from a contact

# Managing Contacts

You should be able to create a new contact from anywhere. If I try to
do something with a contact that doesn't exist yet, it should be
created and I should be prompted to add as much information as I have
on that person.

There should be an API for creating contacts so 3rd party apps (like
iPhone apps) can run them.

I should be able to create contacts by forwarding or ccing an email
from my email account to the system.
